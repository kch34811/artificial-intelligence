You can think of the keys of the defaultdict as representing the positions in
the sparse vector, while the values represent the elements at those positions.
Any key which is absent from the dict means that that element in the sparse
vector is absent (is zero).
Note that the type of the key used should not affect the algorithm. You can
imagine the keys to be integer indices (e.g., 0, 1, 2) in the sparse vectors,
but it should work the same way with arbitrary keys (e.g., "red", "blue", 
"green").
